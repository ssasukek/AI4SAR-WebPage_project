The Teams page is where coordinators manage people and deployments. It’s optimized for quickly answering: who’s available, where they are, and what they’re assigned to.

Top bar (shared): AI4SAR logo (left), centered search (to find a team/member), hamburger menu (right).

Team roster grid/list: Each team is shown as a card (or compact row) with:

Team name / identifier

Current assignment (incident name or “Unassigned”)

Member count + key roles

Last update time

Team detail panel (click/select): Shows members, roles, contact methods, notes, and a simple activity log (check-ins, assignment changes).

Quick actions: Buttons like Assign to Incident, Mark Available, Request Check-in, and View Location (if you support it).

Design: Clean, low-clutter layout with readable cards, strong status visibility, and minimal text—built for fast scanning.
