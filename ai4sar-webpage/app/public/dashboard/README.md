The Dashboard is the main “mission control” screen for AI4SAR. It’s designed to be fast to scan under stress and focuses on surfacing the most important information first.

- Top bar (shared across pages): AI4SAR logo on the left, a centered search bar for incidents/resources, and a hamburger menu on the right for navigation.

- Primary focus area: A clean “Active Incidents” section showing the most recent or highest-priority cases as cards. Each card includes a short title, location/region, last update time, and a simple status badge (e.g., Active / Monitoring / Closed).

- Quick stats strip: Small summary tiles near the top (e.g., Active Incidents, New Tips Today, Teams Deployed, Weather Alerts) to give an at-a-glance snapshot.

- Live updates feed: A “Latest Updates” panel listing incoming reports/tips/log entries in chronological order, optimized for quick reading.

- Suggested actions: A lightweight “Next Actions” or “Recommendations” panel that highlights what a coordinator might do next (e.g., review new tip, confirm last known point, assign team), with emphasis on transparency/explainability.

- Layout + style: Minimal, modern, dark theme with subtle borders/glass panels and generous spacing. The page avoids clutter and prioritizes readability and hierarchy over dense data tables.
