Artificial Intelligence for Search & Rescue (AI4SAR)


The Vision
Artificial Intelligence for Search & Rescue (AI4SAR) represents a transformative approach to one of the most critical challenges in emergency response: finding missing persons efficiently and effectively. This groundbreaking initiative brings together cutting-edge artificial intelligence with decades of search and rescue expertise to revolutionize how SAR operations are conducted.

The Team & Origins
AI4SAR is a collaborative partnership between California Polytechnic State University's Computer Science and Software Engineering Department and experienced search and rescue leaders. Founded in the summer of 2021 through private funding, the project has evolved into a comprehensive research initiative involving undergraduate and graduate students working alongside SAR veterans Gary Bloom and Dr. Chris Young. Under the guidance of Dr. Franz J. Kurfess, the AI4SAR Team is advancing the field through rigorous student-led research, senior capstone projects, and master's thesis work.


The Problem We're Solving
Today's search and rescue operations rely heavily on paper-based systems—dozens of forms developed by organizations like the Bay Area Search and Rescue Council (BaSARC) and FEMA. While invaluable, this approach makes real-time analysis overwhelming and inefficient. Information gets siloed, patterns go undetected, and critical decision-making happens without the full picture.

Our Solution: A Data-Driven Approach
AI4SAR transforms search and rescue through three strategic pillars:

1. Digital-First Data Collection
We're transitioning SAR operations from paper to intelligent digital systems, enabling real-time data capture and seamless information sharing.

2. Intelligent Data Enrichment
By combining on-the-ground observations with external intelligence—historical datasets like Dr. Bob Koester's ISRID database, mapping technology, GIS systems, and environmental data—we create a comprehensive operational picture that human decision-makers can act on immediately.

3. AI-Powered Optimization
Advanced machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI techniques analyze multi-modal data to provide:

Probabilistic predictions about where missing persons are most likely to be found

Resource allocation recommendations

Strategic planning and scheduling guidance

Real-time incident dashboards for coordination

Advanced Technology Stack
Our intelligent platform—IntelliSAR—leverages state-of-the-art AI technologies:

Semantic Search & Web Technologies for flexible, intelligent queries

Machine Learning & Deep Learning for pattern recognition and prediction

Generative AI & Large Language Models for document processing and knowledge extraction

Network Graph Analysis to visualize connections and clues

Geospatial Analysis for targeted search zone optimization

Multi-Modal Neural Networks that integrate weather, satellite imagery, and natural language clues

Research Innovations
The AI4SAR team has developed sophisticated tools including:

Search and Rescue Ontology (SaRO) - A comprehensive knowledge framework for SAR operations

Clue Graphs - Network visualizations that reveal relationships between evidence and location patterns

AI-Generated Knowledge Graphs - Automated extraction of intelligence from text, emails, transcripts, and documents

Heat Maps with Probability Distributions - Visual representations showing the highest-probability locations for successful rescue


Why It Matters
Missing person cases demand speed and accuracy. By bringing AI into the search and rescue process, we're not replacing experienced SAR professionals—we're amplifying their expertise with data-driven insights they can act on immediately. This means faster response times, smarter resource allocation, and ultimately, better outcomes for the families and communities who need help most.

AI4SAR demonstrates how academic research and practical emergency services can combine to save lives.
